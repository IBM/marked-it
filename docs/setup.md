# Setting up your marked-it environment

This Markdown generator is available from npmjs.com, making it easier than ever to install!

1. If you don't already have it, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. At a command-line, on both Mac and Windows run: 

   `npm install marked-it-cli`

   or

   `npm install -g marked-it-cli`

After installation you will find the generator at `node_modules/marked-it-cli`.

> **Note**: Extensions are packaged in the generator and can be found in `node_modules/marked-it-cli/example`.
