## How to suggest changes or updates to the code

All you need is a GitHub ID, and you can suggest edits and changes to marked-it. You can also contribute new extensions. A team member will review any pull requests, and merge all or parts of your suggested changes as quickly as possible.

To make your changes:

1. Go to [github.com/IBM/marked-it](https://github.IBM/marked-it) and fork the project or create a branch right from the repository.
2. Edit files or upload new files.
3. When your changes are complete, send a pull request from your branch with your changes.
4. Wait for a team member to review your changes and merge all or parts of your suggested changes.
5. After you are notified of your changes, tidy up your branches using the delete button in the pull request or on the branches page.
