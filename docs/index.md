title: IBM Cloud Markdown Generator
---
IBM Cloud has designed a parser that transforms Markdown into HTML5. Because the syntax available in standard Markdown is limited, the IBM Cloud team has developed extensions to provide an enhanced authoring experience.

These extensions provide key features available in DITA today, for example the ability to use metadata attributes and content references in Markdown. 

This site provides instructions for setting up your environment, authoring in Markdown by using extensions, and troubleshooting errors.
