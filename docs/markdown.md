# Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.  It is designed to facilitate easy conversion to HTML.

* Markup language that is easy for the average person to use
* Popular with developers, so increases ease of collaboration
* Free! It doesnâ€™t require a fancy, expensive editor

## Markdown markup and styling

The Markdown markup supported in marked-it starts with the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/). For a full list of markup, see [Markup mapping - Lightweight DITA, Markdown, HTML 5](mapping). 

In general, the following style guide should be used:

| Markup | Styling |
|----------|---------|
| `#` | Depending on the level, output as bold and larger text |
| `*word*` or `_word_` | Emphasis (italics) |
| `**word**` | Bold |
| `` `word` `` | Monospace |
| `` *`word`* `` | Bold monospace |
| `* unordered list item` or `- unordered list item` | Bulleted list item |
| `1. ordered list item` | Numbered list item |
| *new line* | Paragraph |
| `` ``` `` | Monospaced with background highlight |
| `[link text](url)` | Blue and underlined |
| `![image text](image-file)` | image embedded in topic |
| *table markup* | table |

IBM Cloud docs should adhere to the highlighting style guidance outlined in the IBM Style Guide.

## Markdown Editors
There are many free Markdown editors available, however, not all editors will honor the syntax used by marked-it extensions. Some options are Notepad++, MacDown, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Orion and others.
